# Code Description


## `main.go`

The `main.go` file contains the main Go program that sets up an HTTP server. It imports necessary packages such as `fmt`, `log`, and `net/http`.

The code defines two handler functions: `formHandler` and `helloHandler`. The `formHandler` function handles the `/form` endpoint and expects a POST request. It parses the form data from the request, retrieves the values of the `name` and `address` fields, and sends a response indicating the success of the request along with the retrieved values.

The `helloHandler` function handles the `/hello` endpoint and expects a GET request. It responds with the message "hello!".

In the `main` function, a file server is set up to serve static files from the `static` directory using `http.FileServer`. The `/` route is handled by the file server, while the `/form` and `/hello` routes are handled by their respective handler functions.

The server is started on port 8080 using `http.ListenAndServe`. If any error occurs during server startup, it is logged using `log.Fatal`.

## `index.html` and `form.html`

These files are HTML templates used for rendering static content.

### `index.html`

The `index.html` file represents a basic static website with a title and an `<h2>` heading.

### `form.html`

The `form.html` file is an HTML form template. It includes a form that sends a POST request to the `/form` endpoint. The form contains input fields for the `name` and `address` parameters, and a submit button.

Please note that the above code is a simplified example and may require additional configuration or modifications to run successfully. Make sure to provide any necessary dependencies or setup instructions in your repository's documentation.
